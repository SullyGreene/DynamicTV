### Introduction

DTVsubscriber enhances the DTV-Guide experience by providing a robust way to integrate any installed plugin quickly and efficiently. As of October 4, 216, new features have been added to improve functionality for users with multiple profiles and to refine the creation of `.ini` files.

### Release Notes - October 4, 2016

#### New Features
- **Profile Fix:** Added a profile fix for users who utilize multiple profiles. This ensures that switching between profiles is seamless and does not affect user settings.
- **Default Profile Settings:** The default now reverts the creator settings back to the master profile, providing a consistent starting point for all users.

#### Upcoming Enhancements
- **INI File Filtering:** We are working on better filtering methods for `.ini` creation. This includes the removal of special characters to ensure compatibility and performance. This feature is currently in progress and expected to enhance the functionality significantly.

### Disclaimer

This version of DTVsubscriber has been developed from the original code by "Primeval" and modified by TeamJDM. It is now maintained under the DTV repo, reflecting ongoing improvements and updates.
